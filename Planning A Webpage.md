# Planning a Webpage:
<strong>Brainstorming:</strong>
* Brainstorm the content on your webpage. Also, focus on what might work on your webpage and what would make it more user interactive.

<strong>Paper Prototyping:</strong>
* Draw your webpage on a paper (as a prototype). This will give you a feel for what your users see and what works and doesn't work.
* You might want to do some user testing, asking your friend or parent how the paper webpage looks.
* Example:

<img src = "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/03b49d7adc97d1363759817a16eea80d-650-80.jpg.webp" width = 200 height = 200>

<strong>Wireframes:</strong>
* Wireframes are like prototypes but more digitally drawn and precise. They're made of boxes that represent each part of a webpage with small bits of text and icons.
* A popular online wireframe tool is [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Another tool, which is free, is [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).
