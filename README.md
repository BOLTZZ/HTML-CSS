# HTML & CSS:
Hi, my name is Ojas and you've found my HTML & CSS repository. Here, I go over some syntax, functions, and share some of my projects. I have done some pretty good websites on [Khan Academy](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/HTML-CSS/blob/master/Khan%20Academy/Table%20of%20Contents.md). Check out my [How To Get Started Guide](https://github.com/BOLTZZ/HTML-CSS/blob/master/How%20To%20Get%20Started%20Guide.md) if your just starting to learn how to code in HTML & CSS.
